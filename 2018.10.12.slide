* Findings

: Presenter notes (This is some text I would like included in the presenter notes, it will be critical for understanding the rest of the talk )

- Breaks of Synteny (BOS) colocalize with Topologically Associated Domain (TAD) boundaries
- Epigenetic marks support this colocalization
- TADs infrequently broken by BOS
- Chromatin interactions are preserved despite gibbon genome shuffling 

* Contex

Gibbon genome is hihgly rearranged

* What's a TAD boundary Look like? 

.image assets/tad.png

: Genes located in the same TAD are often coregulated, and have similar epigenetic marks

* What's a Break of Synteny (BOS) look like? 

.image assets/BOS.png

: break of synteny: a locus of the gibbon genome whose 5' and 3' ends are homologous to different, non-syntenic segments of human genome. They found about 67 in gibbon (33 single bp res). 

* Chromatin contacts are depleted across the break of Synteny

: Average Hi-c Signal acrossw regions of all 33 identified BOS. Local Regression on 100kb windows +- 2.5Mb of BOS. Would like to see the enrichment vs. BOS plot for the first two figures as well. 

* Though it's not obvious without averaging..

* Conserved overlap of BOS and TADs (400-600kb)

.image assets/fig4.png

: Averaged contact maps from other species at orthologous BOS sites. Permutation tested the overlap of BOS and TAD binned by size for each species. 

Significant overlap between BOS and boundaries of TADs in the 400â€“600kb bin

* TADs infrequently broken by BOS

.image assets/fig5.png

: The majority of the Topologically associated domains were retained, rarely broken

* Chromatin interactions are preserved despite gibbon genome shuffling

: Each side of the break of synteny has a distinct epigenetic landscape (H3K4me3, CpG density). They found significant enrichment of CpG and SINE elements surrounding the breaks of synteny which have been described as characteristics of TAD boundaries.

*  No relationship between age and residual methylation suggests epigenetic stability.

* Two Prevaling models

- Fragile TAD Boundary

- TAD boundary selection


* Fragile TAD Boundary

: DSBs will therefore occur more frequentlyat TAD boundaries than at other genomic regions and have a higher chance to be repaired and evolutionarily fixed.

* TAD boundary selection

: DSBs occur equally at TAD boundaries and within TADs. However, rearrangements altering TAD structure by misplacing or deleting TAD boundaries are lost through purifying selection, whereas those maintaining TADs intact are more likely to become evolutionarily fixed. In a small portion of the cases, new TAD boundaries might emerge (green diamond) and survive in the population.

* Implications

- Functional genomic units remain intact despite genomic shuffling

- "Ghost interactions" could be long distance DNA interactions that are a solution to maintaining important regulatory networks after genomic rearrangement.
